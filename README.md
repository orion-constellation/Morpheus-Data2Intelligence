# D2Intelligence: The Data --> Intelligence Pipeline
## Goals:

1. Automate the collection, collation and processing of data, processing --> and delivery of intelligence.
2. Recognize the distinction between raw data and contextually relevant information.
3. Grow to become a recognized source of intelligence.
4. Mitigate bias whether cultural, temporal or geographical.
5. Use the developed intelligence as data to train defensive models in different verticals.

## Data:
Collect raw data from diverse sources.


## Intelligence:
### Transform raw data into actionable intelligence using Traditional ML and Contemporary LLM technology as well as semantic knowledge sources

### Context:
1. Embed data within its relevant context to enhance understanding and decision-making.
2. Use data structures such as graphs with additional semantic knowledge embedded in them (Knowledge Graphs)
3. Find the connections between the M&TRE Attack and Atlas Frameworks

### Outliers:
- Identify and analyze deviations from the norm to uncover potential threats.
- Classify new threats and contribute to the pool of Data.

### Data Sources
- Traditional Vendor Threat Feeds wherever feasible.
- NoSQL Database: store relatively static, unchanging information in a scalable and flexible NoSQL database.
- Vector Databases: leverage vector databases for tasks where similarity and semantics are paramount and at close to real time

### Orion Network:
- As the Orion network matures, it will contribute high-quality intelligence reports.
- Every Node in the network will be providing Data to the Platform for Analysis and Reporting

### Reinforcement Learning:
- Integrate feedback from node operators to continuously improve the intelligence pipeline.

## Summary
D2Intelligence automates the upper echelons of the intelligence pipeline, from data ingestion to the production of summative reports and alerting systems. A human remains in the loop when confidence levels are low, complemented by random sampling to ensure reliability. The system aims to achieve a dependable false positive/negative rate, leveraging novel technologies and methodologies.

The feasibility of this ambition hinges on the trajectory of our technological advancements. For now, we plead insanity as always.
